Validators secure the network AND verify businesses, earning equity in companies they approve. This creates aligned incentives for quality verification.

### 2. **Tier-Based Staking System**
- Bronze (50K HODL) → Micro businesses
- Silver (150K HODL) → Small businesses  
- Gold (350K HODL) → Medium businesses
- Platinum (750K HODL) → Large businesses
- Diamond (1.5M+ HODL) → Enterprise/Unicorns

### 3. **24/7 Global Equity Markets**
Never-closing markets with instant settlement, enabling global capital flows without traditional exchange limitations.

### 4. **True Blockchain Ownership**
Users own actual tokens in their wallets, not IOUs through brokers. Complete transparency with public cap tables.
